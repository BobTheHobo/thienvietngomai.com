Hi there :3

What am I doing at 3:26 AM the night before an organic chemistry exam? Setting up my blog, perhaps because of irresponsibility, pleasure, or sheer denial. I don’t mean to scare you off already, so I suppose introductions are in order. My name is Viet and this is my blog. Now for some answers to your questions.

  - **What is the purpose of this blog?**
> Threefold. First as a lesson in self discipline, second as an expression of myself, and third as an exercise in writing.

- **What will you be posting on this blog?**

  >Thoughts, tutorials, and other tidbits on anything, really. I want to keep it as open and arbitrary as possible in order to fulfill the aforementioned purposes. The point is to just write. Maybe it will become a personal diary, devolve into ramblings, branch out into climbing, Blender, Unity, YouTube, skateboarding, Valorant, PCs, or any combination of these. 

- **How often will you be posting?**

  >Once a day, everyday, for 365 days. Starting today, 7/21/2022.

- **Why should I read this blog?**

  >Because you’re curious? Only you can answer this one my friend.

- **How did you set up this blog?**

  >Github Pages and Jekyll. My website’s first iteration had some wonderful static HTML+CSS set up, but it sat there collecting dust for a year because I never had the motivation to write custom HTML for every page. So, I scraped it and moved to Jekyll, which is generating this very page that you’re reading on. 

- **What’s next?**

  >Maybe a deeper dive into setting up a similar website? Tune in tomorrow to find out.

<br/>
Whether I succeed or fail, I look forward to what this has in store for me a year from now. 

**Onwards and Upwards,**

<h3>Viet</h3>

P.S. My dad’s birthday was yesterday on the 20th. Go wish him a happy birthday!
