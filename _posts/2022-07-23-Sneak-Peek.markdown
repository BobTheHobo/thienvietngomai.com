Day 2 and Iâ€™ve already almost forgotten to write. Technically it is 3 AM on the 23rd, but weâ€™ll count this post as for the 22nd. Itâ€™ll be our little secret. However, I need to get to sleep so hereâ€™s a sneak peek of what the next several posts will be about.

It feels like cheating to count a post as short as this, but any progress is still progress (+ I got to learn how to include images in Jekyll).

**Onwards and Upwards,**
